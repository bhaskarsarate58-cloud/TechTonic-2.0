Aim

Create a simple landing page section using HTML and CSS.

Focus

Neat and clean structure, semantic HTML, and responsiveness rather than advanced-level design.

What I did?!

I created a section titled “Why TechTonic-2.0” to explain the purpose and benefits of the platform in a clear and beginner-friendly way.

Semantic Tags that i Used & Why i chose this?
<section>

I used the <section> tag to wrap the entire “Why TechTonic-2.0” content because it represents a separate and meaningful section of the landing page.

<header>

The <header> tag was used to separate the heading content from the main body of the section.
This improves structure, accessibility, and makes the document easier to understand for both developers and screen readers.

<h1> and <h3>

<h1> was used for the main section heading to make it prominent , look bolder and bigger.

<h3> was used for sub-headings as they are neither too large or small nor too bold for feature titles.

<article>

Each individual idea (such as Beginner Friendly, Open Source Learning, Mentor Guided) is wrapped inside an <article> tag because each one represents a self-contained and a unique concept.

<div>

<div> elements were used only where grouping was necessary.
Class names were added to style each part easily using CSS.

<br>

Used sparingly to add line breaks within text where appropriate.
Most spacing was handled using CSS for better control.

<hr>

Used at the end of the section to visually separate it from other page content.

CSS & Layout Decisions

Flexbox was used for layout arrangement because it provides flexibility and responsiveness.

The layout was tested to ensure it looks clean on mobile (Android), Windows, and macOS screens.

Background Image

A background image related to OpenCode / tech culture was added to enhance visual appeal while keeping text readability in mind.
The image was applied only to this section so it supports the content instead of distracting the user from it.

What I Learned

How semantic HTML improves readability and structure

How small changes in HTML and CSS significantly improve clarity

How to choose suitable color combinations for better UI

How to balance design with responsiveness

Conclusion

This task helped me become more confident in writing meaningful HTML and styling it properly using CSS.
It also improved my understanding of structuring real-world landing page sections.
